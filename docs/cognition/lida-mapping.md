# LIDA Mapping  
Linking the LIDA Cognitive Architecture to Symbia’s Cognitive Scaffolding

The LIDA (Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent) architecture models human cognition as a continual cycle of perception, attention, action selection, and learning.  
Symbia adapts its actionable components—not to imitate biology, but to structure long-horizon reasoning around stable identity, memory, and constraints.

## 1. Why LIDA Matters for Symbia
LIDA distinguishes between:
- **Transient activation** (short-lived signal processing)
- **Workspace consciousness** (globally broadcast representations)
- **Learning updates** (long-term integration)

This aligns closely with Symbia’s need to separate:
- **ephemeral model predictions**
- **stable identity + state substrate**
- **persistent continuity across sessions, devices, and tasks**

LIDA provides a vocabulary and structure for these distinctions.

## 2. LIDA → Symbia Component Mapping

### 2.1 Perception Module → Surface Layer  
LIDA’s sensory encoding maps to Symbia’s *surface adapters*:
- chat, SMS, email
- voice, AR, browser extensions
- metadata channels (biometric, contextual, system-level)

Purpose:  
Convert unstructured input into normalized cognitive events.

---

### 2.2 Workspace (“Consciousness”) → Continuity Engine  
LIDA’s “global workspace” becomes Symbia’s continuity substrate:
- holds last known state  
- diff’d identity graph  
- time-aware context  
- active goals / pending commitments  
- cognitive drift tracking  

This is the core of Symbia’s “mind-like” stability.

---

### 2.3 Attention Codelets → Cognitive Priorities  
LIDA uses “attention codelets” to determine relevance.  
Symbia replaces these with:

- **priority array** (Safety → Comfort → Clarity → Convenience → Personality)  
- **explicit constraints**  
- **role-specific biases**  
- **user preference weights (Symbikey)**

This prevents LLM drift and ensures predictable behavior.

---

### 2.4 Action Selection → Role-Scoped Agents  
Symbia’s “agents” are NOT autonomous bots.  
They are **role-specific execution shells**:

- Researcher  
- Challenger  
- Synthesizer  
- Editor  
- Architect  
- Narrator  
- Orchestrator

Each one reads from the same continuity substrate but selects actions differently.

---

### 2.5 Long-Term Memory → State Substrate + Identity Graph  
Where LIDA updates stable long-term memory, Symbia updates:

- identity graph nodes  
- preference vectors  
- constraint signatures  
- narrative timeline  
- per-surface behavioral deltas  

These updates occur only with user consent.

---

## 3. The LIDA Cycle → Symbia Cognitive Loop

### LIDA Cycle:
Perception → Workspace → Attention → Action → Learning

### Symbia Loop:
Surface Input  
→ Normalization  
→ Continuity Engine (workspace)  
→ Priority Array + Constraints  
→ Role-Scoped Output Agent  
→ State Update (identity + timeline)  

This loop turns **stateless LLMs into stateful collaborators**.

---

## 4. Deviations from LIDA (On Purpose)

Symbia *does not* adopt:
- subconscious / preconscious distinctions  
- biological mechanisms  
- emotional modeling  

Symbia *does* adopt:
- global broadcast-style context  
- time-bounded cycles  
- priority-based relevance evaluation  
- structured integration of memory  

The goal is *computational cognition*, not biological simulation.

---

## 5. Summary

LIDA offers a mature template for:
- separating transient vs persistent cognition  
- structuring cycles of perception, attention, action  
- defining global workspace dynamics

Symbia builds on this but adapts it for:
- identity portability  
- multi-surface continuity  
- role-scoped collaboration  
- explicit trust and drift constraints  
- cognitive timeseries
