# Identity docs index

This folder currently contains identity-related guides:

- **updating.md** — operational notes for the `/identity/update` endpoint and the identity envelope re-signing flow.
- **persona.md** — guidance for capturing and mirroring operator persona preferences.
- **key-update-quickstart.md** — hands-on steps to re-sign an identity envelope with a symbikey payload via `/identity/update`.

If you only see one file in your editor, refresh the workspace or reopen the folder to ensure both documents are visible.
