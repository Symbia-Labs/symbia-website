## Emerging Mechanics of the Symbia Key (Draft)

The Symbia Key will encode:
- identity seed
- capability set
- actor/worker entitlements
- persona deltas
- behavioral shaping parameters

Future versions may embed a lightweight broker-style representation where key contents are exposed as hierarchical topics:
  symbia/key/<section>/<field>

This enables:
- subscription-driven identity propagation
- hot persona reconfiguration
- fine-grained entitlement validation within missions
