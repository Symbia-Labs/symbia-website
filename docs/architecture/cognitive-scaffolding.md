## Keys as Cognitive Scaffolding
The cognitive scaffolding layer binds LLM reasoning to a persistent identity.

Keys provide:
- stable identity
- behavioral continuity via traits
- prioritization and routing
- safety constraint shaping
- mission grounding

Broker-backed operational keys form a reactive fabric that missions and actors continuously subscribe to.
This gives LLMs an execution substrate they cannot create alone.
