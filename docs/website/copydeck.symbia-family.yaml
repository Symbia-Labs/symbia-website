    bullets:
      - "Symbia is an execution-layer doctrine for agentic systems."
      - "It governs how software agents act, not how models predict."
      - "Protocols connect components. Models produce probabilities."
      - "Symbia defines what is allowed to run, where, and under whose responsibility."

    bullets:
      - "Not a model."

    title: "Symbia Seed"

    bullets:
      - "Agents operate independently within signed limits."
      - "APIs, tools, files, and networks stay allowlisted."
      - "Every step records provenance, constraints, and uncertainty."

  epistemic_layer:
    title: "Probabilistic reasoning, governed"
    lede: "Symbia does not eliminate uncertainty. It makes uncertainty explicit, bounded, and accountable."
    bullets:
      - "Probabilistic reasoning is attached to execution."
      - "Confidence, provenance, and limits travel with every decision."
      - "Uncertainty is declared before actions run."
      - "Evidence remains audit-ready after runtime."

    title: "Why Symbia"
    gap: "Ungoverned execution is risk."
    gap_points:
      - "Actions run without boundaries. Uncertainty hides. Responsibility blurs."
      - "Autonomy without enforcement creates liability."
    solution: "Governed execution"
    solution_points:
      - "Boundaries and policy precede action."
      - "Identity and accountability bind to every step."

    title: "Governed execution"
    lede:
      - "Safety is enforced before execution, not inferred after."
      - "Capabilities are scoped. Time, authority, and surfaces are bounded. Classes of failures are prevented, not merely logged."
    pillars:
      - "Define what may run; actions require identity, policy, and constraints."
      - "Stop unsafe work early by bounding time, authority, and surfaces."
      - "Prevent, then log; block disallowed work and record permitted actions with proofs."

  execution_surfaces:

    bullets:
      - "Agents do not act everywhere."
      - "They act on defined execution surfaces: APIs, tools, files, networks."

  execution_layer_positioning:
    title: "Where Symbia fits"
    lede:
      - "Above models and protocols. Below applications and interfaces."
      - "Symbia governs execution, not cognition or transport."
    bullets:
      - "Above models. Symbia does not shape predictions."
      - "Above protocols. Symbia does not move packets."
      - "Below applications. It governs what runs before interfaces act."
      - "Execution is the focus. Cognition and transport stay separate."

  observability_and_audit:
    title: "Evidence from every action"
    lede:
      - "Every action produces structured traces."

      - "Each step records who acted, what ran, and under which limits."
      - "Execution is ordered and replayable for review."
      - "Identity and policy bind to every action and artifact."
      - "Evidence persists so outcomes can be explained to humans and institutions."

    headline: "Execution-layer story in one place."
    statement: "Symbia is a governed execution layer for agentic systems. It makes automation and autonomy observable, auditable, and safe. Identity, policy, and uncertainty bind to every action."
    qa:
      - "What Symbia governs: execution, not prediction."
      - "How autonomy stays bounded: scoped time, authority, and surfaces."
      - "Why uncertainty is explicit: evidence and limits travel with actions."
