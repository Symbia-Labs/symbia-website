# Commercial Landscape  
A survey of companies, platforms, and ecosystems adjacent to Symbia’s execution-layer thesis.

---

## 1. Agent Builders (Execution-Simulation Tools)

These platforms attempt to create “agents,” but none provide durable identity, long-term memory, or continuity. They mostly orchestrate prompts and tools.

### **LangChain / LangGraph**
Strengths: massive adoption; graph-based control flows  
Limits: memory is still retrieval-based; no persistent identity; agents reset per graph run  
Relevance to Symbia: illustrates how orchestration is not cognition.

### **OpenAI Assistants API**
Strengths: tools, retrieval, structured outputs  
Limits: no real continuity; memory is fetch-based; identity unstable  
Relevance: confirms market appetite for execution-layer capabilities.

### **Anthropic Workflows (early ecosystem)**
Strengths: constitutional constraints  
Limits: no long-horizon memory  
Relevance: alignment layer without continuity.

### **Microsoft Autogen**
Strengths: multi-agent coordination demos  
Limits: brittle, high token cost, ephemeral state  
Relevance: multi-agent proof-of-concept but not an architecture.

## 2. “AI Teammate” Companies  
These present agents as collaborators but still rely on stateless, prompt-based interactions.

### **Lindy**
Pitch: AI Chief of Staff  
Limits: instruction-following agent with high-level tasks, no persistent identity  
Relevance: proves demand for collaboration, but lacks substrate.

### **Cognition Labs (“Devin”)**
Pitch: AI engineer  
Limits: focused on coding autonomy, ephemeral memory  
Relevance: single-task autonomy demo, not a cognitive layer.

### **Replit Agents**
Pitch: execution agents for building applications  
Limits: prompt chains; resets each session  
Relevance: demonstrates agentic demand inside dev ecosystems.

### **Lovable**
Pitch: AI app builder  
Limits: UI-focused, no continuity; not cognitive  
Relevance: democratizes prototyping; not an execution layer.

---

## 3. Workflow / Automation Companies  
These extend automation with LLM hooks but do not attempt cognition.

### **Zapier / Make.com / n8n**
Strengths: automation; integrations  
Limits: step-by-step flows; no semantics; no persistence  
Relevance: Symbia is *not* workflow automation — it is cognitive scaffolding.

### **Adept (defunct in current form)**
Goal: agents that operate software  
Limits: brittle, no identity  
Relevance: highlight of unsolved architectural issues.

---

## 4. Cognitive / Identity-Like Startups  
Closest category, but still incomplete.

### **Rewind AI**
Pitch: personal memory  
Limits: storage only; no cognition, no identity model  
Relevance: proves personal-memory demand.

### **Mem.ai**
Pitch: personal knowledge assistant  
Limits: retrieval-based; no reasoning continuity  
Relevance: highlights gap between data and cognition.

### **Thirdlaw**
Pitch: policy enforcement & AI safety controls  
Limits: not cognitive; fits governance layer  
Relevance: perfect complement for Symbia’s consent/audit stack.

### **Subkeys**
Pitch: capability-scoped API keys  
Limits: infrastructure tool  
Relevance: essential building block for Symbia’s “SymbiKey” concept.

---

## 5. Enterprise AI Platforms  
These integrate AI but don’t attempt durable agent cognition.

### **Salesforce Einstein / Oracle AI / IBM Watsonx**
Strengths: enterprise integration  
Limits: rigid architectures; no cognitive substrate  
Relevance: potential adopters when the execution layer becomes required.

---

## 6. Market Insight: What Is *Not* Being Done  
Across the entire commercial ecosystem:

- No company provides agent identity as a first-class primitive.  
- No company provides durable, evolving memory grounded in a cognitive model.  
- No company provides multi-agent continuity across sessions.  
- No company provides user-governed cognition with portable identity.  
- No company provides execution-layer semantics (constraints, state, roles).  
- No company provides the substrate for long-horizon reasoning.

Everyone is building wrappers, demos, and tools.  
No one is building the **architecture of cognition**.

---

## 7. Summary  
Commercial activity proves enormous demand for agents — but all current platforms simulate cognition with orchestration tricks.  
Symbia’s opportunity is not to join this crowd.  
It is to define the missing *substrate* the entire category will require.
