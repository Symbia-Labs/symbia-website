# Execution layer
- Eyebrow: Execution layer
- H2: Above protocols with deterministic identity and explicit epistemics.
- Meaning: Symbia is the execution layer that keeps identity and epistemics intact while coordinating workers, tools, and models. Deterministic identity comes from the Genesis Key Specification (GKS) and the Symbia Key; probabilistic epistemics come from the Open Epistemic Protocol (OEP). Runs locally so lineage, constraints, and logs stay under your control.
