# How it works — canon -> abstraction -> artifact
- Eyebrow: Canon/Abstraction/Artifact
- H2: Deterministic identity holds canon; probabilistic reasoning stays explicit.
- Canon: missions, revisions, cues, and checkpoints live in canonical ledgers with Genesis Key lineage.
- Abstraction: Supervisor + Workers choose models/tools per policy; OEP keeps evidence and uncertainty explicit.
- Artifact: Docs, diffs, and UI views inherit provenance and can be replayed or audited.
- Pillars: identity & lineage (GKS/Symbia Key), evidence & epistemics (OEP), governed execution (Supervisor + Workers), observability (traces/ledgers/telemetry).
