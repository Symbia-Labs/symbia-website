- Eyebrow: Press & Media
- H2: Execution-layer story in one place.
- Press statement: Symbia is the execution layer above protocols — deterministic identity (GKS), probabilistic epistemics (OEP), canon -> abstraction -> artifact architecture, local-first substrate, and auditable artifacts for teams that need traceability.
- Founder Q&A highlights:
  - Why deterministic identity matters: Genesis Key + Symbia Key lineage, drift detection.
  - How canon -> abstraction -> artifact reduces hallucination and keeps outputs attributable.
  - Why local-first and consent-centric execution remain default.
  - Where OEP/GKS go next: supervised workers, multi-surface observers, richer trace schemas.
