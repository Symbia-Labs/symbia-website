- Eyebrow: Execution layer
- H2: Symbia is the execution layer above protocols.
- Lede: Seed keeps identity deterministic (Genesis/Symbia Key) while coordinating probabilistic LLM reasoning via the Open Epistemic Protocol. Canon -> abstraction -> artifact turns traces into auditable outputs with signed lineage, supervised workers, and observable endpoints.
- Support: Local-first, supervised, and observable through API (api.html), ledgers, and the Observer UI.
- CTAs: Primary — Try it out (symbia-seed.html). Secondary — Open API Explorer.
