- H1: Symbia is the execution layer above protocols.
- Lede 1: Symbia Seed runs locally to anchor identity (GKS) and evidence while coordinating probabilistic LLM reasoning through the Open Epistemic Protocol. Identity stays deterministic; epistemics stay explicit.
- Lede 2: Canon -> Abstraction -> Artifact turns traces into auditable outputs. Local-first runtime with signed lineage, supervised workers, and observable endpoints so you can prove how results were produced.
- CTAs: Try it out (symbia-seed.html), Open API Explorer (api.html)
- Chips: Genesis Key (GKS) lineage; OEP-coded evidence; Canon -> Abstraction -> Artifact
